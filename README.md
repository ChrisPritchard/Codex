# Codex

A fiction-focused word processor.

## Background

I do the [NaNoWriMo](https://github.com/ChrisPritchard/Codex) competition every year, and have won every year - no bragging :D - usually writing with MS Word. I have used more...focused tools like [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) before, but ultimately found them too busy and not 'source control' friendly - Scrivener for example would create large, unwieldy, non-text files that are hard to persist via Github. Word wouldn't too, of course, but Word at least has a much smaller file save size.

This project is an attempt to marry F#, WPF via dotnet core 3.0 and the elmish architecture (via the excellent [Elmish.WPF](https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF)) to create a writing tool, a word processor if you will, that is targetted towards writing novels and novels alone, with plenty of useful planning and outlining features but with an overall minimalist aesthetic.

## Project Status

Very much still a work in progress. In particular, I might have to take a break to actually write the novel for NaNoWriMo 2019 in the middle of dev - the tool won't be ready in time for November, at least at time of writing. WPF and XAML is a syntax/technology I haven't used in anger in half a decade, and now that I am using it again I find very much that I am using it in ANGER :) Its not too bad, but the learning curve is slow.

So, WIP!
